# RISC-V SoC Research Task - Synopsys VCS + DC_TOPO Flow (SCL180)

In this task I have replace all open-source simulation tools in the existing flow and transition fully to Synopsys tools, while preserving design correctness and documentation quality.

# Toolchain Migration

I completely remove the following tools in my flow:

   . iverilog
   . gtkwave

Tools I used in this lab are :

VCS - U-2023.03
